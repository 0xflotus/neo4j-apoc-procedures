# list of removed functions and procedures for 4.0

All freetext/fulltext stuff has been removed in favour of 3.5+ productized fulltext indexes.

## procedures

apoc.index.relatedNodes (index feature ootb)
apoc.index.orderedRange (index feature ootb)

apoc.algo.* (use separate graph algo apackage instead)

apoc.static.get (proc deleted, function exists)
apoc.static.getAll (proc deleted, function exists)

apoc.monitor.locks() (proc deleted, cannot get information via api)


## functions



## changed behaviour

* apoc.agg.statistics on an empty list returns `null` for `min` and `max`. Used to be `0` previously

* all apoc* configuration option needs to be moved to `apoc.conf`
** `apoc.initializer.cypher`
** *apoc.initializer.cypher.<anything>`


** mongo calls use `compatibleValue:true` by default. Reason: 4.0 doesn't support java.util.Date as nested value in a map returned from a procedures.
Side effect: date values are returned as millis since epoc.
