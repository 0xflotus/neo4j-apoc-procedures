== Collection of useful Procedures for Neo4j 3.x

Just build it with `./gradlew jar`.
Then copy `build/libs/neo4j-apoc-procs-0.1.jar` to your server's `plugins` directory.

If you want to run embedded or use shell on a disk store, configure your `plugins` directory in `neo4j.properties` with `dbms.plugin.directory=path/to/plugins`.

== Included Procedures

* `apoc.util.IN(value, coll)` optimized IN operation (using a HashSet)
* `apoc.util.sort(coll)` sort on Collections

== Plans

* optimized collection functions
* Time Conversion Functions (ISO<->ts, padded long representation)
* custom expanders, e.g. with rel-type suffixes

== Later Plans

* Graph Refactorings
* Job Queue
* Procedures in other languages (e.g. JS)
